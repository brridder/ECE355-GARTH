Introduction

\chapter{Functional Requirements}

\section{High-level functionality}
The high level functionality of this system can be broken down into several
major sections. Sensors play a major role in interfacing the real world with
the several other sections of the controller. Physical security, both inside
and outside of the home is important. This goes hand in hand with family
security once family members have left the premises of the household. Finally,
green energy management can be easily integrated with the other systems to
ensure prudent usage of resources. 

\subsection{Sensors}
% TODO :: proof read this. It may not all make sense

% TODO :: elaborate HVAC or put it in the glossary
The most crucial part of the system that ties all of the other parts together
is the sensor network. They are the interface between the real world and the
controllers. They detect if the house has been intruded upon by outsiders
through sensors on the windows and doors. They can alert the family if somebody
left the stove top on. Living patterns can be established and monitored to
warn of health problems or to control the HVAC so that energy is not wasted
when nobody is home or they are all asleep. Cameras, motion detectors, hall
effect sensors, and other miscellaneous sensors comprise the majority of this
network.

Cameras play multiple roles in the sensor network. Facial recognition can be
used to detect family members entering and leaving the house to track their
activities. They can be used to alert when strangers are approaching the door
or are on the premises in either a friendly manner or in a more cautious one
depending on the family members currently at home.

Motion detectors provide the security system with the means to trigger alerts 
when motion is detected in certain areas of the home while the system is armed. 
A network of motion detector sensors will be positioned in the hallways of the home, 
with particular attention to entries to the home. Motion detectors outside the 
house will be able to control the lighting system such that people approaching the 
home can be illuminated and easily identified.

Temperature sensors and hall effect sensors are two other major components.
Temperature sensors can be used by both physical security, to ensure that the
oven has not been on for an extended period of time without user interaction as
well as for green energy management to control the overall temperature of the
house or each room. Hall effect sensors can be used with temperature sensors to
detect if windows or doors have been left open when they should be closed in
order to prevent wasting energy. These sensors can also be used to detect
intruders attempting to break in through windows or doors.

\subsection{Family Safety}

In addition to necessary home security functionality, the system will incorporate 
methods to provide safety to members of the users' family. Child safety is a particular 
concern that will be addressed by this portion of the home security system. Sensors 
will be implemented on cabinets as well as certain areas of the home that may contain 
hazardous materials that could be harmful to children. Contact sensors will be present 
on medicine cabinets, closets with cleaning materials, and knife drawers to alert the user
that these areas of the home have been accessed.

\section{Interfaces}

\chapter{Non-Functional Requirements}

\chapter{User Interfaces}
The main user interface for this system is the user's smart phone device. Most
individuals have a smartphone, be it an iPhone or an Android device, and
integration into these platforms would make it easy for users to adopt to the
system.

%Paired with near-field communication it will

\section{Smartphone Application}
A smartphone application will allow the user to monitor their residence as well
as turn on or off various components of the system. If the device has
near-field communication built into it, then it will be able to be used to
arm and disarm the system upon entry or when leaving the premises. 

The application will have three main purposes. The first is to display data and
statistics over time in a easily understood manner. The second is to allow fine
control over various sub-systems such as the state of the security system,
thermostat, and lights -- both interior and exterior. The final duty is to
track the status of each family member through GPS integrated into the mobile
device. 

It is relatively simple application. Figure~\ref{fig:wireframe-home} shows a
wireframe of the first screen seen when the application is started. This is the
main navigation between the different features. A simple settings wireframe is
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:wireframe-settings}. Not all capabilities are shown in
the wireframes to reduce complexity. What is displayed is dependent on the
capabilities of the system and the installed modules. Navigation flow is also
omitted to avoid any platform specific paradigms. Access control is required to
prevent younger family members from accidently unlocking doors or disarming the
security system.

            {Wireframe of the settings screen}
    \label{fig:wireframe-settings}
\end{figure}

Various portions of the security system can be controlled through the wireframe
in Figure~\ref{fig:wireframe-security}. The entire system can be armed and
disarmed, locks on doors activated and deactivated, and the status of the
windows can be reported. Pressing on the button for window status will bring up
another more detailed screen that lists individual windows and reports their
status, closed or open. Door locks, if it is supported can be locked or
unlocked from this screen if the lock supports it.

    \caption[Wireframe of the security screen]
            {Wireframe of the security screen}
    \label{fig:wireframe-security}
\end{figure}

Environmental details are controlled in Figure~\ref{fig:wireframe-environment}. The
temperature of the house can be monitored and set. Pressing on the button
labeled "HISTORY" will bring up a graph of the household temperature over a
period of time. This screen can also display images from cameras at the doors
to allow for the user to check who is at the door before unlocking it.
Details from more specific portions of the enviroment can be displayed here as
well. For example, the status of the stove and oven in the kitchen. It is also
possible to report the internal temperature of the oven to ensure that it is
not overheating.

    \label{fig:wireframe-environment}
\end{figure}

Family member locations -- at least those with smartphones and this
application -- are displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:wireframe-locations}. Each family
member will have a pin on the map to show their location using their device's
GPS capabilities. Clicking on a name will move the map to the present location
of that person. It will also display in text where the family member presently
is located.
