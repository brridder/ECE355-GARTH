\section{Development Platform}
%In general terms, describe the anticipated platform on which this system will
%be developed, including the implementation language, major libraries and
%network protocols utilized, and special language or OS or middleware features
%used, such as remote procedure calls, a built-in event handling model, user
%interface library, etc.

\section{Runtime Platform}
%Describe the platform on which this system will be deployed and run, including
%the operating system, any required middleware, and hardware. You may describe
%the prototype in particular, if the final system is still unclear.

% Controllers:
%   OS = Linux
%   Hardware = Server blade with redundencies
%  
% Sensors:  
%   OS = tinyOS
%   Hardware = Microcontroller with Zigbee
%
% Middleware:
%   Communication between sensors and controllers (via the server) with a
%   xigbee base station connected to the server.

The platform is divided into two major types of components, controllers and
sensors. Both types have different requirements for operating systems and
hardware. Middleware is required to interface between the two subsystems as well. 

The controllers will all operate on a single server as seperate processes. The
server will be a Linux based server orientated distribution such as CentOS or
Debian. The server will be housed locally within the house. The hardware needs
to be powerful, yet energy efficient and compact. No dependance on exact
hardware is required. Some recommended specifications are outlined in
Table~\ref{server_hardware}.

Each sensor will have its own independent hardware and operating system due to
the independent nature of these devices. Each will have an Atmel AVR ATMega
microcontroller for reading sensor data and communicating through the Zigbee.
The tinyOS operating system can be used to quicken development time and the
protocols for communication with the Zigbee. The tinyOS will also simplify
setting up the mesh network as several modules are provided for this.

Some middleware is required to interface the sensors and the controllers
through a Zigbee and microcontroller connected via USB to the server. A simple
hardware interface is required to allow for two-way communication between the
controllers and the sensors.

\section{Process Model}
%Describe whether the system is multi-threaded, runs on concurrent processes, or
%is distributed. Identify the major concurrent activities and objects (you may
%refer to the object or dynamic model), and how they will be manifested on the
%target system.

\section{Synchronization}
%Describe the method of coordination and synchronization between software
%tasks, such as semaphores or message queues.

\section{Fault Handling}
%Explain how errors will be handled. For instance, describe the use of
%exception handling in the system. Discuss how the system may recover from
%software or hardware failure.
